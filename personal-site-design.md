How will you buid your site to support you desired user experience?
    Start with my draft site "map"
    and use the F-shaped read lines
    my map looks something like this (I had a "I'm a company mind frame"):
      HOME (consisting of) >>Logo, connect, portfolio
      ABOUT >> Origins, People, Motto/vision
      DEV ACADEMY CONCEPTS (all the blogs until now)
      PROJECTS (this will links to future pages)

      logo = small pic
      connect = contact details, office hours, location, and twitter/fb icons etc.
      protfolio = link to all my various portfolio (future me will have)

      Origins = how I got to here
      People = (this will be the people I work with one day)
      Motto/Vision = the thing I strive for
