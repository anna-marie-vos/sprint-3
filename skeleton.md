What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550px?
  Elements that were next to each other now apprear below each other.
How do you think that works?
  They use @media queries; which basically works the same way as an "if function"
  in excel: "if" the width of the webpage is "greater than" 550px, "then"
  make .container width 80% and column margin 4%, and a bunch of other things.
